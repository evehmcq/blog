### Not the best start
July weather to kick off the holiday.

### Football in the garden
The grass was really wet but Oli had his professional grade footie boots on and Jack took his shoes off and played in his socks and then his bare feet. Tackling someone with boots on in your berries is challenging so he went and washed his feet with water from the kettle. Great views and the sound of sheep in the distance.

The house is pretty spacious. Oli wore his McQuarrie Man Utd shirt in an attempt to intimidate his Dad. You can just see Jack chillin in the window upstairs.

It turned out to be a fine sunset.
