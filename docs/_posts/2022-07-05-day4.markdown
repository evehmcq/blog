### Prospects for today
Maybe a bit of shopping and a trip to Forvie or Balmedie beach.   

Here's our supply of wood for the wood-burning stove. I suppose they must be very slow burning.

There's no sympathy in football just because you're old.

### Forvie beach
...as recommended by Gav.  

No option but the selfie.

Can't go to the beach without at least one football.

At least there was a photogenic train carriage.

Loads of dead birds which, according to several locals, is due to avian flu.
